## [Syntax support](#syntax-support)

Tailwind CSS uses a lot of custom CSS at-rules like `@tailwind`, `@apply`, and `@config`, and in many editors this can trigger warnings or errors where these rules aren’t recognized.

The solution to this is almost always to install a plugin for your editor/IDE for PostCSS language support instead of regular CSS.

If you’re using VS Code, our official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin includes a dedicated Tailwind CSS language mode that has support for all of the custom at-rules and functions Tailwind uses.

In some cases, you may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict about the syntax it expects in your CSS files.

## [IntelliSense for VS Code](#intelli-sense-for-vs-code)

The official [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension for Visual Studio Code enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

+   **Autocomplete**. Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as [CSS functions and directives](https://www.tailwindcss.cn/docs/functions-and-directives).
+   **Linting**. Highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup.
+   **Hover Previews**. See the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by hovering over it.
+   **Syntax Highlighting**. Provides syntax definitions so that Tailwind features are highlighted correctly.

## [Automatic class sorting with Prettier](#automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)

We maintain an official [Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for Tailwind CSS that automatically sorts your classes following our [recommended class order](https://www.tailwindcss.cn/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).

It works seamlessly with custom Tailwind configurations, and because it’s just a Prettier plugin, it works anywhere Prettier works — including every popular editor and IDE, and of course on the command line.

```html
<!-- Before -->
<button class="text-white px-4 sm:px-8 py-2 sm:py-3 bg-sky-700 hover:bg-sky-800">...</button>

<!-- After -->
<button class="bg-sky-700 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-sky-800 sm:px-8 sm:py-3">...</button>
```

JetBrains IDEs like WebStorm, PhpStorm, and others include support for intelligent Tailwind CSS completions in your HTML and when using `@apply`.
